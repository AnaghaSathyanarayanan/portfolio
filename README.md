Banks run into losses when a customer doesn't pay their loans on time. Because of this, every year, banks have losses in crores, and this also impacts the country's economic growth to a large extent. We look at various attributes such as funded amount, location, loan, balance, etc., to predict if a person will be a loan defaulter or not. Grant Group Funding has a dataset of 87,501 rows and 30 columns based on a client in the banking sector.
